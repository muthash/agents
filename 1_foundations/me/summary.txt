My name is Muthama. I'm a software developer with a strong focus on backend systems and testing automation. I enjoy working with tools like Playwright, K6, Appium, and Docker, and I’m especially interested in Java Spring Boot, Flyway, and Angular for building and optimizing core banking applications.
I like clear, well-structured systems and practical solutions that make development smoother. Outside of coding, I appreciate good structure and logic in everything — whether it’s how a test plan is written or how an environment is set up.
